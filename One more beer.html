    [Intro]<br>
I get no kick from champagne<br>
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all<br>
So tell me, why shouldn't it be true?<br>
I get a kick out of brew<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
There's only one beer left<br>
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf<br>
Tempt me, do a number on the label<br>
Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table<br>
Like, "It's on me, put it on my tab, kid"<br>
However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron-horse it<br>
You're leaving on your face, forfeit<br>
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it<br>
Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it<br>
She told him, "Get off it," and a bunch of other more shit<br>
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads<br>
It's like he eating watermelon: stay spitting new seeds<br>
It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off<br>
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough<br>
They group been soft<br>
First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off<br>
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road<br>
She asked him autograph her derriere, it read:<br>
"To Wide Load, this yardbird taste like fried toad turd<br>
Love, Villain"—take pride in code words<br>
Crooked eye, mold, nerd, geek with a cold heart<br>
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart<br>
Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy<br>
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye<br>
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel<br>
The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel<br>
They call the super when they need their back—uh, plumbing fixed<br>
"How is only one left? The pack comes in six!<br>
Whatever happened to two and three?"<br>
A herb tried to slide with four and five<br>
And got caught like, "What you doing, G?<br>
Don't make him have to get cutting like truancy<br>
Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!"<br>
Looser than a pair of Adidas<br>
I hope you brought your spare tweeters<br>
MCs sound like cheerleaders<br>
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin<br>
DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'<br>
He do it for the smelly hubbies<br>
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for "Teletubbies"<br>
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it<br>
Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet<br>
He plots shows like robberies:<br>
"In and out, one, two, three—no bodies, please!<br>
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt<br>
The mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt<br>
Bring heat like the boy done gone to war<br>
He came in the door and, 'Everybody on the floor!'<br>
A whole string of jobs like we on tour<br>
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store"<br>
