[Intro: Pebbles the Invisible Girl, MF DOOM] <br>
    Mic Check<br>
    When I was led to you<br>
    I knew you were the one for me<br>
    Come through, dig the sound<br>
    I swear the whole world could feel you MC<br>
    Crowd around<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 1: MF DOOM]<br>
    I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop<br>
    Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot<br>
    Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound<br>
    Of the fly brown 6' 0" sicko psycho who throws his dick around<br>
    Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap<br>
    It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped<br>
    Femstat cats get kidnapped<br>
    Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that<br>
    Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility<br>
    Broken household name usually said in hostility<br>
    Um... what is MF? You silly<br>
    I'd like to take "Mens to the End" for two milli'<br>
    "Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double<br>
    Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo<br>
    Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black<br>
    Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac<br>
    [Chorus: MF DOOM]<br>
    On Doomsday, ever since the womb<br>
    ‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say<br>
    Right above my government; Dumile<br>
    Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 2: MF DOOM]<br>
    I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section<br>
    If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then<br>
    Cell number seventeen, up under the top bunk<br>
    I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk<br>
    Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped<br>
    God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape<br>
    Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children<br>
    One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building<br>
    While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer<br>
    I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer<br>
    A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime<br>
    Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime<br>
    Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste<br>
    Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent<br>
    And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness<br>
    Real mens mind their own business<br>
    That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch<br>
    How come I hold the microphone double-clutch<br>
    C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found<br>
    On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown<br>
    [Chorus: MF DOOM]<br>
On Doomsday!, ever since the womb<br>
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say<br>
Right above my government; Dumile<br>
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: MF DOOM]<br>
Doomsday, ever since the womb<br>
‘Til I'm back to the essence, read it off the tomb<br>
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?<br>
Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"<br>
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk<br>
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk<br>
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang<br>
Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang<br>
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang<br>
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans<br>
Only gin and Tang<br>
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang<br>
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth<br>
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth<br>
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth<br>
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth<br>
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce<br>
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife<br>
Strong enough to please a wife<br>
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life<br>
