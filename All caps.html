    So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me<br>
    Daily told the people "You can call me Your Majesty!"<br>
    Keep your battery charged<br>
    You know it won't stick, yo<br>
    And it's not his fault you kick slow<br>
    Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow<br>
    Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go<br>
    And you know I know that's a bunch of snow<br>
    The beat is so butter<br>
    Peep the slow cutter<br>
    As he utter the calm flow (your mother)<br>
    Don't talk about my moms, yo<br>
    Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow<br>
    Or vice versa<br>
    Whip up a slice of nice verse pie<br>
    Hit it on the first try<br>
    Villain: the worst guy<br>
    Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses<br>
    Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses<br>
    And he won't stop 'til he got the masses<br>
    And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses<br>
    Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo<br>
    Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo<br>
    It's ugly, like look at you<br>
    It's a damn shame<br>
    Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name<br>
    And you know it like a poet, like baby doll<br>
    I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball<br>
    All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged<br>
    And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig<br>
    Allegedly, the investigation is still ongoing<br>
    In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'<br>
    The pot doubles, now they really got troubles<br>
    Madman never go pop like snot bubbles<br>
    <br>
